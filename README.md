## Unicorn Flames

Repository for Processing sketch demonstrating blurring using Perlin Noise array

This project was created in response to the the Daniel Shiffman's Coding Challenge #103: Fire Effect on the Coding Train YouTube channel.

The video can be viewed here:(click on the image below to go to the YouTube video)

The sketch makes use of the following two classes:

**NoiseArray** - creates a 'scrollable' array of Perlin Noise values

**BlurringImage** - wraps the algorithm featured in the video to blur the flame images

Three layers of 'fire' were used to create the image below
